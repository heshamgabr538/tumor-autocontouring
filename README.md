# Breast tumor USG images' autocontouring method

The script implements an automated way to generate contours around breast tumors on USG images. The dataset, provided within the repository comes from [OnlineMedicalImages](http://www.onlinemedicalimages.com/index.php/en/example-pages).

Algorithm needs two coordinates to be pointed: the centre of the tumor and the point inside of it, indicating the length of the radius of the circle fiiting entirely inside of the tumor's area. 
Both of these coordinates are pointed by user's clicks at the beginning of each image's processing.

The accuracy of a generated contour is measured with two metrics: Sørensen–Dice coefficient and Haussdorff distance. Model contours are provided together with sample images and are also contained in the input_images folder.
The report .txt file is generated by the script and contains the results of its operation. The method achieved a mean score of 82% (F1) and 10.06 (Haussdorff).

This work was completed as a project assignment during the course of Medical Imaging Techniques at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland.
